# Sample Scenarios for the Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework
# Each scenario is a natural-language description that the Meta-Orchestrator
# will analyze to determine the required agent ensemble and coordination strategy.

Scenario 1: Urban Search and Rescue
A 7.2-magnitude earthquake has struck a densely populated urban area. Multiple
buildings have collapsed, and emergency services are overwhelmed. The system must
coordinate search-and-rescue teams, medical responders, logistics coordinators,
and communication relay agents to maximize survivor recovery within a 72-hour window.

Scenario 2: Collaborative Research Synthesis
A research team needs to produce a comprehensive literature review on "Federated
Learning in Healthcare." The system must deploy agents for paper discovery,
relevance filtering, key-finding extraction, cross-paper synthesis, and
contradiction identification across 200+ candidate papers.

Scenario 3: Supply Chain Disruption Response
A critical semiconductor supplier has halted production due to a factory fire.
Multiple downstream manufacturers are affected. The system must coordinate
inventory assessment agents, alternative supplier scouts, logistics rerouting
planners, and stakeholder communication agents to minimize production delays.
