"""
Agent Factory — Dynamic Agent Synthesis Module (Placeholder).

This module will be responsible for the runtime creation of specialized
agent instances based on scenario analysis performed by the Meta-Orchestrator.

Planned Capabilities (Future Phases):
  - LLM-driven role inference: Analyze scenario descriptions to determine
    the types and number of agents required.
  - Dynamic agent instantiation: Create concrete BaseAgent subclasses at
    runtime using role templates.
  - Agent lifecycle management: Track active agents, handle creation,
    suspension, and termination.

This module is part of the Dynamic Agent Creation subsystem described in
the project's research roadmap.

      3. Instantiate and configure agents with appropriate capabilities.
