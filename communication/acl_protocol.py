"""
ACL Protocol — Agent Communication Language Module (Placeholder).

This module will implement the structured messaging protocol used for
inter-agent communication within the orchestration framework. The design
is inspired by FIPA ACL (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents —
Agent Communication Language).

Planned Capabilities (Future Phases):
  - ACL message structure: Define message types including INFORM, REQUEST,
    PROPOSE, ACCEPT, REJECT, and QUERY performatives.
  - Message routing: Route messages between agents based on recipient
    addressing and broadcast channels.
  - Conversation tracking: Maintain conversation threads and support
    multi-turn dialogue between agents.
  - Protocol enforcement: Validate message format and performative
    sequencing according to interaction protocols.

This module is central to the ACL-style Communication subsystem described
in the project's research roadmap.
