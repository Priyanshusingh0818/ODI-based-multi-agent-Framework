"""
Long-Term Memory — Persistent Knowledge Store Module (Placeholder).

This module will implement persistent, cross-session memory using vector
database integration. Long-term memory allows agents to accumulate
knowledge across multiple scenario executions and retrieve contextually
relevant information via semantic search.

Planned Capabilities (Future Phases):
  - Vector database integration: Store and retrieve memory entries using
    embedding-based similarity search (e.g., via ChromaDB or FAISS).
  - Knowledge persistence: Maintain agent knowledge across sessions,
    enabling learning and adaptation over time.
  - Memory consolidation: Promote important short-term memories to
    long-term storage based on relevance and frequency of access.

This module is part of the Memory-Aware Coordination subsystem described
in the project's research roadmap.
