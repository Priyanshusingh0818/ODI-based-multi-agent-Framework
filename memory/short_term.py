"""
Short-Term Memory — Working Memory Module (Placeholder).

This module will provide transient, session-scoped memory for individual
agents. Short-term memory enables agents to maintain context within a
single scenario execution cycle.

Planned Capabilities (Future Phases):
  - Context window management: Store recent observations, messages, and
    action history for use in the agent's decision-making process.
  - CTDE integration: In the Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution
    paradigm, short-term memory serves as the agent's local observation
    buffer during decentralized execution.
  - Capacity limits: Implement configurable memory capacity with eviction
    policies (e.g., FIFO, relevance-based pruning).

This module is part of the Memory-Aware Coordination subsystem described
in the project's research roadmap.
