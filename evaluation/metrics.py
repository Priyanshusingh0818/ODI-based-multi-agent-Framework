"""
Evaluation Metrics — System-Level Performance Assessment Module (Placeholder).

This module will implement quantitative evaluation metrics for measuring
the performance of the multi-agent orchestration framework across
multiple dimensions.

Planned Capabilities (Future Phases):
  - Task completion rate: Measure the percentage of scenario objectives
    successfully achieved by the agent ensemble.
  - Communication efficiency: Evaluate the ratio of useful information
    exchange to total message volume in the ACL protocol.
  - Agent utilization: Assess how effectively each agent contributes to
    the overall scenario resolution.
  - Coordination overhead: Quantify the cost of orchestration relative
    to the productive work performed by agents.
  - Adaptability score: Measure the system's ability to handle novel
    or dynamically changing scenarios.

This module is part of the System-Level Evaluation subsystem described
in the project's research roadmap.
